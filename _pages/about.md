I am a PhD student at [Aramis Lab](https://www.aramislab.fr/), an Inria research team working with the Brain and Spine Institute. I am currently working at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en/), the applied mathematics lab of École polytechnique, under the supervision of [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and [Stanley Durrleman](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Stanley.Durrleman/).

My thesis is about data sets of networks and how to model them from a statistical perspective. I work on both theoretical and algorithmic aspects. The main application is modeling the humain brain connectivity, especially functional connectivity.
