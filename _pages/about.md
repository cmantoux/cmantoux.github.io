I am an R&D engineer at [SNCF Réseau](https://www.sncf-reseau.com/), the company in charge of maintaining and operating the french rail network. I work at [DGEX Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dgex-solutions/) on ML applications to railway-related problems. If you are interested in ML on graphs, don't hesitate to reach me out!

Before that, I did a postdoc at the [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) Inria research team. I worked with [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/) on kernel methods and Sum of Squares models, with applications to statistics and machine learning. I did my PhD at [Aramis Lab](https://www.aramislab.fr/), an Inria research team at the Brain and Spine Institute, and [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en/), the applied mathematics lab of École polytechnique. I worked under the direction of [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and [Stanley Durrleman](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Stanley.Durrleman/). My thesis is mostly about data sets of networks and how to model them from a statistical perspective. I worked on both theoretical and algorithmic aspects. The main application is modeling the humain brain connectivity, especially functional connectivity.
